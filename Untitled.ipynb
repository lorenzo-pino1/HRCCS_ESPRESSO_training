Ehrenreich et al. uses two runs, both public: 1102.C-0744(C) and 1102.C-0744(D). In the window that opens, click on \"FileList\". That gives you a list of all science exposures in that run. We \"Mark all\", and \"Request marked datasets (new service)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not just need the science exposures, but also the calibrations, in order to run the pipeline. So let's \"run association\" of the **raw** calibrations (not processed). After the associatiton is done (it takes a while), we can download everything. I recommend the shell script.\n",

    "You should have lots of fits files. Most of them are calibrations, and may contain a date that does not coincide with the observational night. The observations have an associated raw2raw.xml, which associates the calibrations to the exposure. If some files are missing, repeat the process."

This is what I am currently using and is suggested, but you may explore the impact of avoiding the sky subtrction.\n",

For example, there are flux calibrated spectra (currently, Feb 2022, ESPRESSO flux calibration is not completely reliable, and not accurate enough to recover the flux at the precision needed for exoplanet atmosphere applications). Finally, there are CCFs calculated by the pipeline with an algorithm which is very similar to the one I give you (but much slower!).\n",
